# Document Object Model

Document Object Model simply shows how different programming languages interact with the HTML file of a web page. Each tag, id, class and so on of an HTML file is represented in DOM as an element or node which can then be used to interact with that particular HTML tag or id. Since the tag is now a node in DOM, it is easily fetched using selector elements like getElementByID, getElementByClassName, querySelector and so on.

Using these selectors, functionality can then be assigned to the HTML element and therefore have a functional page. We can also access HTML text, change the HTML text, and change other things about the HTML file using DOM. These and many more can be carried out with DOM.
